## Cypress info

* [RSVP for our next meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Test-Masters-Series/events/246672899/) during which we will discuss more advanced Cypress features
* Have a look at the [Cypress.io YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-EOsTo2l2x39e4JmSaWNRQ/videos)
* Join the [Cypress.io Chat](https://on.cypress.io/chat)
* [Check out the roadmap](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/roadmap.html)
