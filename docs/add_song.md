To complete this exercise have a look at the following commands:

- ```cy.get()```
- ```cy.click()```
- ```cy.type()```
- ```cy.last()```
- ```cy.should()```

## Exercise:
**Let's create our first Song and validate it is shown on the first page.**
- On the Songs, page click the + button to create a new Song, you will now land on the Create song page. 
- First thing you should do is validate that you are on the right page, do this by checking if the button is visible
- Create a song by filling in all the fields, they are all mandatory, click the button and validate that the song is created on the first page.
- Tip use the last command because your song will be the last one on the list.

### If you get stuck

On the create page almost every element has an id, try to use the CSS-selector id and you will find this exercise a walk in the park

Have a look at this page if you want to refer to all the possible [css selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp).
